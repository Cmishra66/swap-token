Technologies Used:

Solidity: Smart contract programming language.
OpenZeppelin Contracts: Reusable smart contract components following best practices.
tested using foundry.

Efficiency Considerations:

Gas Costs: Gas costs are kept relatively low by using simple arithmetic for the exchange rate calculation.
Security: The contract checks for sufficient balances and ensures that the exchange rate is greater than zero.
Events: Events are emitted to log swap details, providing transparency for users.
Certainly! Below is an example of a test document outlining various test cases for the ERC-20 Token Swap Smart Contract. Please note that these test cases are illustrative, and additional test scenarios may be needed based on the specific requirements and functionalities of the contract.

# ERC-20 Token Swap Smart Contract - Test Cases

## Test Case 1: Initial Setup

**Objective:** Verify the correct initialization of the contract.

1. **Input:**
   - ERC-20 TokenA and TokenB addresses.
   - Exchange rate: 100 (1 TokenA = 100 TokenB).

2. **Expected Result:**
   - Contract is deployed successfully.
   - TokenA and TokenB addresses are set correctly.
   - Exchange rate is set correctly.

## Test Case 2: Swap TokenA for TokenB

**Objective:** Test the swap of TokenA for TokenB.

1. **Input:**
   - User has 100 TokenA.
   - User initiates a swap of 50 TokenA.

2. **Actions:**
   - User calls `swapAForB` with 50 TokenA.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - 50 TokenA is transferred from the user to the contract.
   - The contract transfers 5000 TokenB (50 * exchangeRate) to the user.
   - Swap event is emitted.

## Test Case 3: Swap TokenB for TokenA

**Objective:** Test the swap of TokenB for TokenA.

1. **Input:**
   - User has 200 TokenB.
   - User initiates a swap of 100 TokenB.

2. **Actions:**
   - User calls `swapBForA` with 100 TokenB.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - 100 TokenB is transferred from the user to the contract.
   - The contract transfers 1 TokenA (100 / exchangeRate) to the user.
   - Swap event is emitted.

## Test Case 4: Invalid Swap (Insufficient Balance)

**Objective:** Test an invalid swap when the user has an insufficient balance.

1. **Input:**
   - User has 10 TokenA.
   - User initiates a swap of 20 TokenA.

2. **Actions:**
   - User calls `swapAForB` with 20 TokenA.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Revert: Insufficient balance of TokenA.

## Test Case 5: Set New Exchange Rate

**Objective:** Test the ability to set a new exchange rate.

1. **Input:**
   - Owner sets a new exchange rate: 150 (1 TokenA = 150 TokenB).

2. **Actions:**
   - Owner calls `setExchangeRate` with 150.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Exchange rate is updated to 150.

## Test Case 6: Swap TokenA for TokenB with New Exchange Rate

**Objective:** Test a swap after updating the exchange rate.

1. **Input:**
   - User has 100 TokenA.
   - User initiates a swap of 50 TokenA.

2. **Actions:**
   - User calls `swapAForB` with 50 TokenA.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - 50 TokenA is transferred from the user to the contract.
   - The contract transfers 7500 TokenB (50 * newExchangeRate) to the user.
   - Swap event is emitted.
